% Complete end-to-end derivation that Furnishing Rush is the
% weakly dominant strategy in 2-player Caverna.

\textbf{Overview.}
We present a complete formal proof that the \emph{furnishing rush} strategy is
the unique weakly dominant pure strategy in 2-player Caverna (the Cave Farmers
European board game by Uwe Rosenberg).  The argument proceeds bottom-up: we
first formalize the game's scoring system, resource economy, and 48 furnishing
tiles, then analyze eight candidate strategy archetypes through an $8 \times 8$
payoff matrix, and finally establish weak dominance, Nash equilibrium
uniqueness, and the price of anarchy.

Formalized in Lean~4 with Mathlib.
